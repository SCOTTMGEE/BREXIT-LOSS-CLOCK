# Brexit Tax Loss Clock

This project is a simple web application that tracks the estimated tax revenue loss to the UK government since leaving the European Union (Brexit). It dynamically calculates the estimated amount of lost revenue and displays what that money could have been used for, such as building hospitals, schools, and prisons.

## Features
- Real-time estimate of the tax loss since Brexit based on a Â£40 billion/year loss.
- Conversion of the lost tax revenue into public services such as hospitals, schools, and prisons.
- Displays the number of days since Brexit.
- UK and EU flags for visual representation.
- Hosted as a static website.

## How It Works
The clock updates every second, showing:
- Total tax loss to the UK government.
- Number of hospitals, schools, and prisons that could have been built with the lost revenue.
- The number of days since Brexit occurred.

The estimation is based on reports suggesting the UK loses around Â£40 billion annually in tax revenue post-Brexit.
